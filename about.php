    nurseryplant germinated in 2014 from a promise to make ‘green and healthy’ a click away for all Indians

Having plants in our homes or in our offices doesn’t just look good, it also boosts our mood, makes us more productive, and cleans the air around us by absorbing toxins

Most of us being urban dwellers spending their days in apartments with limited access to parks and ecological reserves, have no way of feeling close to nature and experiencing the benefits of being around plants.

Ordering a pizza is easy but ever heard of ordering a plant to your doorstep? This is where nurseryplant comes in.

Plants and flowers do give completely different vibes. Keeping plants in the house not only makes your home look beautiful but also, helps you with your health. Plants are natural air purifiers, keeping them in your house helps in purifying the air and increasing the oxygen level. Green colors are also soothing for the eyes. There is a variety of plants to choose from for your house. 
A Nursery is a place where plants are nurtured and raised under specific environmental conditions and then are sold. Managing a Nursery is a long-term project and needs a lot of attention to detail. Managing an entire business process manually can cost a lot of time and effort. To help run a business smoothly having an online system to manage it, would not prove to be a bad decision for your business.
